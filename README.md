# Virtual-Mouse
It is a software based project developed in Python language and Open CV Technology. The webcam detects the hand movements and the cursor moves according to hand movements.
The Virtual Mouse is based on Open CV Technology and this can be used as an alternative mouse if somehow your desktop/Laptop/wireless mouse is not working properly.

The code is given in this repository.
